Replace private.pem and privateaes.bin with your own keys - your signing key must be for the _secp256k1_ curve, in PEM format. You can create a .PEM file with:

```bash
openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -out private.pem
```

The AES key is just a 32 byte binary file - you can create one with:

```bash
dd if=/dev/urandom of=privateaes.bin bs=1 count=32
```

You will need to program your OTP using the generated `otp.json` file generated by the build in your build folder
NOTE: This will enable secure boot on your device, so only correctly signed binaries can then run, and will also lock down the OTP page the AES key is stored in. 
If you wish to test without enabling secure boot, you can load the `otp.json` file in the source folder ([otp.json](otp.json)) instead which will just program the AES key and lock down that OTP page.
```bash
picotool otp load otp.json
```

> For more information on security see chapter 10 of the [RP2350 datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf), and for information on how to sign other binaries to run on a secure chip see chapter 5.10

Then either drag & drop the UF2 files to the device in order (enc_bootloader first, then hello_serial_enc) waiting for a reboot in-between, or run
```bash
picotool load enc_bootloader.uf2
picotool reboot -u
picotool load -x hello_serial_enc.uf2
```
